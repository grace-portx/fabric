## Fabric

### Fabric Doc

My own Fabric documentation based on what I did with Fabric including the custom UI.

### map_prompt

This is the custom pattern that I created to use with Fabric.

### command.py

The script is for running the command '(cat {file_path}; echo "attribute: {attribute}") | fabric --model gpt-4o -sp map_prompt' with user input.

### app.py

The script that creates the UI that allows users to interact with Fabric easier.
