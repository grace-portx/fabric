Metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is the formal definition of a region that consists of a city and surrounding communities that are linked by social and economic factors. Micropolitan Statistical Areas (MISA) are CBSAs associated with at least one urban cluster that has a population of at least 10,000, but less than 50,000.  The micropolitan statistical area comprises the central county or counties or equivalent entities containing the core, plus adjacent outlying counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the central county as measured through commuting.\n",
